# Vaquita Lisk

# Save to Earn Protocol on Lisk

Vaquita Lisk is an innovative **Save to Earn** protocol built on the Lisk blockchain, seamlessly integrated with Velodrome's concentrated liquidity pools. The protocol enables users to earn rewards simply by saving and providing liquidity, creating a sustainable ecosystem where saving becomes a profitable activity.

## üéØ Core Concept

The Save to Earn model incentivizes users to maintain their deposits over time, rewarding them for their commitment to the ecosystem. By integrating with Velodrome's advanced concentrated liquidity management, users can maximize their yield while contributing to the overall liquidity of the Lisk DeFi ecosystem.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Smart Contract Layer
- **VaquitaPool**: The main user-facing contract, upgradeable via OpenZeppelin's TransparentUpgradeableProxy pattern. Handles user deposits, withdrawals, reward distribution, and integrates with the liquidity manager. Features pausable and ownable access control for security and upgradability.
- **VelodromeLiquidityManager**: Core contract managing user deposits and liquidity provisioning, also upgradeable and pausable.
- **Automated Liquidity Management**: Handles complex Uniswap V3/Velodrome position management
- **Share-Based Accounting**: Precise tracking of user contributions and rewards using shares, ensuring fair and transparent distribution.
- **UUID-Based Deposit Tracking**: Each deposit is tracked with a unique identifier (UUID), allowing for flexible and independent management of multiple deposits per user.
- **Upgradeable & Modular**: All core contracts are upgradeable using OpenZeppelin's upgradeable contracts, allowing for future enhancements and security patches without redeployment.

### Key Features
- **Single-Token Deposits**: Users deposit LSK tokens, automatically converted to optimal liquidity positions
- **Concentrated Liquidity**: Leverages Velodrome's advanced liquidity management for maximum efficiency
- **Reward Distribution**: Earn rewards based on deposit duration and amount
- **Flexible Withdrawals**: Users can withdraw their deposits and accumulated rewards at any time
- **Gas Optimization**: Efficient smart contracts designed for cost-effective operations
- **Pausable**: Both VaquitaPool and VelodromeLiquidityManager can be paused by the owner for emergency response
- **Upgradeable**: Proxy pattern allows seamless upgrades and maintenance

## üí∞ Economic Model

### Save to Earn Mechanics
1. **Deposit Phase**: Users deposit LSK tokens into the protocol
2. **Liquidity Provision**: Tokens are automatically deployed to Velodrome concentrated liquidity pools
3. **Reward Accumulation**: Users earn rewards based on:
   - Deposit amount
   - Time held in the protocol
   - Pool performance and fees
4. **Withdrawal**: Users can withdraw their original deposit plus accumulated rewards

### Reward Sources
- **Trading Fees**: Share of fees from Velodrome pool transactions
- **Protocol Rewards**: Additional incentives for long-term savers
- **Liquidity Mining**: Rewards for providing essential liquidity to the ecosystem
